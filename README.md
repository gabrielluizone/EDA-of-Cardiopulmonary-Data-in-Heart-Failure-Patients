Performed in-depth statistical analysis using R on cardiopulmonary exercise test data for 127 heart failure patients. Generated visualizations including histograms and boxplots to examine distribution and identify outliers in key oxygen consumption variables. Analyzed 4 evaluation timepoints - rest, anaerobic threshold, respiratory compensation point, and peak exercise. Computed summary statistics revealing high positive skewness in most variables. Created frequency table and charts to analyze distribution of NYHA functional class with 4 levels represented. Demonstrated analytical skills, programming abilities, and thorough understanding of descriptive statistics methodology.
